## Description

_The submit button on this website adds various properties to a pizza object. It gives the pizza a size and toppings based on the user's selection, and it pushes numbers into a "costBreakdown" array for that pizza object that match the value of the size and selected toppings. It then totals up the numbers in this array and displays the total as the cost of the pizza._
