#### _By **Dave Sarbora**_

## Description

_The submit button on this website adds various properties to a pizza object. It gives the pizza a size and toppings based on the user's selection, and it pushes numbers into a "costBreakdown" array for that pizza object that match the value of the size and selected toppings. It then totals up the numbers in this array and displays the total as the cost of the pizza._

## Specifications
* _Program inputs are data collected from a form, which are then converted into prices via the "toppings" and "sizes" arrays._
------------------------------------------
* _If only a size is specified, then only the price of that size is outputted._
* _Example input: "Small"                       Output: 6.99._
------------------------------------------
* _If a size and toppings are specified, the price of the size, and each topping, are added and the total is outputted._
* _Example input: "Small, pepperoni, sausage"   Output: 11.99._
------------------------------------------
* _If toppings are specified but size is not, the makePizza function will be unable to run and no output will show.
* _Example input: "pepperoni, sausage"          Output: ''
